                Hello! My name is Wendy, and welcome to my personal website. I’m currently a student exploring the intersection of technology, data, and creativity. 
                I’m passionate about how software engineering and artificial intelligence can make an impact in the real world—from automating complex tasks to improving decision-making in healthcare and beyond.

                This website is a small introduction to who I am and what drives me. I enjoy learning new programming languages, visualizing data, and building things that people find useful.
                When I’m not coding, I love exploring new coffee shops, taking photos, and diving into music playlists that make every day a bit more colorful. 
                Through this site, I’ll share a bit more about my interests, recent projects, and ways to connect with me. Thanks for visiting!
